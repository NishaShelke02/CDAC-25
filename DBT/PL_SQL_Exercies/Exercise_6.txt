1. Write a stored procedure by the name of Comp_intr to calculate the amount of interest on a bank account that compounds interest yearly. The formula is:- I = p (1+ r) y â€“ p
where:-
I is the total interest earned.
p is the principal.
r is the rate of interest as a decimal less than 1, and
y is the number of years the money is earning interest.
Your stored procedure should accept the values of p, r and y as parameters and insert the Interest and Total amount into tempp table.
--->CREATE TABLE tempp (interest NUMBER, total_amount NUMBER);

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE Comp_intr (
    p IN NUMBER,
    r IN NUMBER,
    y IN NUMBER
)
AS
    interest NUMBER;
    total_amt NUMBER;
BEGIN
    interest := p * POWER(1 + r, y) - p;
    total_amt := p + interest;

    INSERT INTO tempp (interest, total_amount)
    VALUES (interest, total_amt);
    
    COMMIT;
END;
/

2. Create a stored function by the name of Age_calc. Your stored function should accept the date of birth of a person as a parameter. The stored function should calculate the age of the person in years. The stored function should return the age in years.
--->CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION Age_calc (
    dob IN DATE
)
RETURN NUMBER
AS
    age_years NUMBER;
BEGIN
    age_years := TRUNC(MONTHS_BETWEEN(SYSDATE, dob) / 12);
    RETURN age_years;
END;
