(SELECT salesperson_id FROM Customers GROUP BY salesperson_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1);


2) Write a command that deletes all customers with no current orders.
---->DELETE FROM Customers WHERE cust_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT cust_id FROM Orders);

3) Write a command that increases by twenty percent the commissions of all salespeople with total orders above Rs. 3,000.

WHERE salesperson_id IN 
(SELECT salesperson_id FROM Orders GROUP BY salesperson_id HAVING SUM(amt) > 3000);
