
1) Write a query that uses a subquery to obtain all orders for the customer named Cisneros. Assume you do not know his customer number (cnum).
----> SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE customer_id = (SELECT customer_id FROM customers WHERE customer_name = 'Cisneros');


2) Write a query that produces the names and ratings of all customers who have above-average orders.
----> SELECT DISTINCT c.customer_name, c.rating FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id WHERE o.order_amount > 
( SELECT AVG(order_amount) FROM orders);


3) Write a query that selects the total amount in orders for each salesperson for whom this total is greater than the amount of the largest order in the table.
----> SELECT s.salesperson_id, s.salesperson_name, SUM(o.order_amount) FROM orders o
JOIN salespeople s ON o.salesperson_id = s.salesperson_id
GROUP BY s.salesperson_id, s.salesperson_name
HAVING SUM(o.order_amount) > (SELECT MAX(order_amount) FROM orders);
