4) Why isn’t it possible to see the first five
rows of a table?
Ans-->
because while saving the rows they are fragmented internally and given space on database hard disk where-ever the space is available and in case we update certain row through char or varchar that time length of row might get increased so that if space is not available then the whole row is moved to the place where the space is available. Hence position of row is not fixed that’s why we can’t see the first five rows of table on surely basis.
