--->SELECT order_number, salesperson_number, (order_amount * 0.12) FROM orders;

2) Write a query on the Customers table that will find the highest rating in each city. Put the output in this form:
For the city (city), the highest rating is : (rating).
---> SELECT city, MAX(rating) AS highest_rating FROM customers GROUP BY city;

3) Write a query that lists customers in descending order of rating. Output the rating field first, followed by the customer’s name and number.
---> SELECT rating, name, customer_number FROM customers ORDER BY rating DESC;

4) Write a query that totals the orders for each day and places the results in descending order.
