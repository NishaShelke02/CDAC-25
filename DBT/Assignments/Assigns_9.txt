JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN salespeople s ON o.salesperson_id = s.salesperson_id;

WHERE s.commission_rate > 0.12;

      (o.order_amount * s.commission_rate) AS commission_amount FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN salespeople s ON o.salesperson_id = s.salesperson_id WHERE c.customer_rating > 100;
